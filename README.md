Eudyptula Challenge
===================

my attempt at learning kernel programming.

assuming this is idiomatic or even working code is a fool's errand that
is bound to end in a furious storm of profanity and `rm -rf`s.

you have been warned.

###Task 01
Write a Linux kernel module, and stand-alone Makefile, that when loaded
prints to the kernel debug log level, "Hello World!"  Be sure to make
the module unloadable as well.

The Makefile should build the kernel module against the source for the
currently running kernel, or, use an environment variable to specify
what kernel tree to build it against.

Please show proof of this module being built, and running, in your
kernel.  What this proof is is up to you.  I'm sure you can come up with
something.  Also be sure to send the kernel module you wrote, along with
the Makefile you created to build the module.
